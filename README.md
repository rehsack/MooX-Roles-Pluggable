# NAME

MooX::Roles::Pluggable - Moo eXtension for pluggable roles

# SYNOPSIS

    package MyPackage;

    use Moo;

    sub foo { ... }

    use MooX::Roles::Pluggable search_path => 'MyPackage::Role';

    package MyPackage::Role::Bar;

    use Moo::Role;

    around foo => sub {
        ...
    };

    1;

# DESCRIPTION

This module allows a class consuming several roles based on rules passed
to [Module::Pluggable::Object](https://metacpan.org/pod/Module::Pluggable::Object).

The basic idea behind this tool is the ability to have plugins as roles
which attach themselve using the `around`, `before` and `behind` sugar
of _Moo(se)_.

The arguments of import are redirected to [Module::Pluggable::Object](https://metacpan.org/pod/Module::Pluggable::Object),
with following defaults (unless specified):

- `search_path`

    Default search\_path is `${caller}::Role`.

- `require`

    Default for require is 1.

## USE WITH CAUTION

Remember that using a module like this which automatically injects code
into your existing and running and (hopefully) well tested programs
and/or modules can be dangerous and should be avoided whenever possible.

## USE ANYWAY

On the other hand, when you're allowing plugins being loaded by your
code, it's probably faster compiling the chain of responsibility once than
doing it at runtime again and again. Allowing plugins changing the
behaviour of your code anyway. When that's the intension, this is your
module.
